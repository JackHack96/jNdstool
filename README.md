jNdstool
========
This tool is the Java version of the popular `ndstool` by Rafael Vuijk, Dave Murphy and Alexei Karpenko of the devkitPro team (https://github.com/devkitPro/ndstool).
It can open a ROM image, extract its files and rebuild a ROM from a folder.
It is based upon Martin Korth's DS specifications, which you can find in the original HTML version at http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#ndsreference, or in a Markdown version at https://mgba-emu.github.io/gbatek/#ndsreference.
